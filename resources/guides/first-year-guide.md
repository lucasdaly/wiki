## Getting Started at the University of Windsor

### UWin Accounts

Every student must have a **UWin Account** in order to access the university's online services. Instructions to set up your UWin account will be sent to your personal email after you've been accepted into a program at the university. You will be assigned a **UWin ID** and will create a password during this process; these will be used as your login information. Your **UWindsor email** will be yourUWinI@uwindsor.ca.

### Online Services

Some of the online services you can access using your UWin Account include:

#### [UWinsite Student](https://student.uwindsor.ca)

For browsing and enrolling in classes, viewing tuition and fees, accessing acedamic information, applying for scholarships, and more. See the [UWinsite Guide](/wiki/resources/guides/uwinsite-guide) for more details and help.

#### [Brightspace](https://brightspace.uwindsor.ca)

The university's Learning Management System (LMS). It is used to view course material, submit coursework, review grades, and more.

#### [Microsoft Office 365](https://portal.office.com/)

All University of Windsor students have access to a full suite of Microsoft Office 365 tools and software, including **Outlook** for email services and **OneDrive**. A Microsoft Account is automatically created using your **UWindsor Email** and **UWin Account Password**. See [this FAQ](https://uwindsor.teamdynamix.com/TDClient/1975/Portal/KB/ArticleDet?ID=9552) for more details.

## Enrolling in Courses

### Which Courses to Take

:::important

These wiki resources are maintained by student contributors. Always verify important academic information with a primary university resource or an academic advisor.

:::

There are several computer science programs offered by the University of Windsor, each with their own course requirements which can be found in [the undergraduate calendar](https://www.uwindsor.ca/secretariat/282/undergraduate-and-graduate-calendars). If you follow the [recommended course sequence](/wiki/courses/course-planning/recommended-sequence), many programs will share the same courses for the first term. 

### Recommended First-Year Course Schedule

**Fall Semester**
- [COMP-1000](/wiki/courses/comp-1000/overview) – Key Concepts in Computer Science  
- [COMP-1400](/wiki/courses/comp-1400/overview) – Introduction to Programming I
- MATH-1250 or MATH-1260 – Linear Algebra I
- MATH-1720 or MATH-1760 – Differential Calculus
- One elective course

**Winter Semester**
- MATH-1020 – Mathematical Foundations (*Honours CS and Honours CS SWE*)
- MATH-1730 – Integral Calculus (*Honours CS and Honours CS SWE*)
- COMP-1410 – Introduction to Programming II    
- COMP-2650 – Computer Architecture I - Digital Design 
- One elective course

See the [Courses](/wiki/courses) section for a user-friendly table of course requirements by program.

### How to Enroll

Incoming first year students typically have the earliest **appointment time** and may enroll in courses before all other students. Your appointment time can be found on [UWinsite](https://student.uwindsor.ca) under **My Academics -> Enrollment Deadlines**. It is recommended to enroll as early as possible, as courses have a limited capacity and desireable timeslots fill up quickly. See the [UWinsite Guide](/wiki/resources/guides/uwinsite-guide#how-to-plan--enroll-in-classes) for more details on how to enroll in classes.

:::warning
Check your schedule on UWinsite before classes start! Course rooms often change last minute.

## Academic Success

### Study and Note-Taking Tips
- Focus on understanding during lectures instead of transcribing everything.
- Take photos of examples or handwritten notes from the board.
- Create short summary sheets to review key ideas.
- Practice problems regularly — programming and math require repetition.
- Teach concepts to someone else to reinforce your understanding.

### Time Management and Balance
- Use **Google Calendar** or **Notion** to organize deadlines.
- Schedule daily study sessions and start assignments early.
- Give yourself breaks and rest. Consistency beats cramming.
- Attend lectures regularly — even familiar material helps reinforce learning.

### Accessibility and Support
- **CS Tutoring:** 2nd floor of Erie/Lambton  
- **Math Tutoring Centre (MSLC):** Erie 3120, open weekdays 12–4 PM  
- **TA / GA Office Hours:** Posted on Brightspace  
- **Professor Office Hours:** See your syllabus  
- **Student Accessibility Services:** [sas@uwindsor.ca](mailto:sas@uwindsor.ca)

:::important 
Avoid relying on AI tools for coding in your first two years. They are not allowed in exams or technical interviews and prevent you from learning essential problem-solving and debugging skills.
